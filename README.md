# recipes-project

This is the README for this repository. In here we'll describe the purpose of the project, how we built it, and describe the organization of the repository.

At some point, we'll probably want to rename our repo, once we settle on a brand name and logo.

For all documentation files, like this, and others, use the .md file extension so that it's easy to read and view in a browser. See (here)[https://help.github.com/articles/markdown-basics/] for an explanation of markdown syntax. 

Here's a quick summary of the root level of the repository:

## design
This directory is where all design related files go. Mockups, Prototypes, proofs of concept, etc. The final CSS, JS, and HTML will go into the _develop_ directory at some point.

## develop
This directory contains the code and project used to build the website.

## docs
This directory holds any documentation related to the project in general. Here is where we'll store ideas for names or features.
